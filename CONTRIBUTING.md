# Contributing

First of all, thank you so much for taking a deeper look at the project. It *does* mean a lot.  

PRs and issues of all sorts are welcome, here are some guides to help you out.  

## PRs

1. Refer to `HACKING.md` for information on the inner-workings of the project. If you're still unsure about anything open an Issue.
2. For commit message, please do your best to use the project's commit labelling techniques to ensure uniformity
3. Name the pull request with the same labelling as commits :+1:
4. Include what you changed, but also why. It'll help give context and help your contributions make more sense.
5. If once opening the pull request the lint workflow build fails, that's ok, take a look at the build and see what went wrong. If you can fix it please do, if not feel free to ask for help.

## Issues

You can throw anything you like (within context) as an issues. However, to help we have three templates for the basic feature requests:

* [General feature request](https://github.com/TechWiz-3/git-commit-emojis/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
* [Select menu option request](https://github.com/TechWiz-3/git-commit-emojis/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=select-menu-option-request.md&title=)
* [Shortcut request](https://github.com/TechWiz-3/git-commit-emojis/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=shorcut-request.md&title=New+shorcut+request)

Also if you want to improve or add to these templates go ahead
