# Contributing

First of all, thank you so much for taking a deeper look at the project. It *does* mean a lot.  

PRs and issues of all sorts are welcome, here are some guides to help you out.  

## PRs

1. Refer to [`HACKING.md`](HACKING.md) for information on the inner-workings of the project. If you're still unsure about anything open an Issue.
2. If you're unure you to help, check out [backlogs.md](backlogs.md) which contains plenty of new features and tasks that need to be imlemented.
3. If you would like to gain approval or discuss how you'll tackle a new feature in a logical sense, open an issue.
4. For commit message, please do your best to use the project's commit labelling techniques to ensure uniformity
5. Name the pull request with the same labelling as commits :+1:
6. Include what you changed, but also why. It'll help give context and help your contributions make more sense.
7. If once opening the pull request the lint workflow build fails, that's ok, take a look at the build and see what went wrong. If you can fix it please do, if not feel free to ask for help.
